### Question: how do I use my own point to start a track?

I dropped a float with a GPS on it.  I picked it up hours later.  How can I see what the model would have predicted for the float?

My starting data...

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(cascophys)
  library(fvcom)
  library(sf)
  library(dplyr)
})

# takes a while!
CB <- CascoBayPhysics(verbose = TRUE)

mystart <- dplyr::tibble(
  lon = -70.127978,      # <- insert your own
  lat = 43.785747,       # <- insert your own
  z = 0,
  time = CB$get_time()[1], # <- sort has to be faked unless you did this in 2018...
  ) |>
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat", "z"), crs = 4326) |>  # make it geospatial
  sf::st_transform(crs = sf::st_crs(CB$M)) # and convert to the projection the mesh uses
```

It's a messy projection description... no handy shorthand 4 digit code here like 4326.

```{r}
mystart
```
